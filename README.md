# ðŸ““ðŸ’€ðŸ‘‘ Skull King Tracker Progressive Web App
A lightweight, client-side tracking app for the Skull King card game built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It records bets, calculates scores, and helps you keep track of outcomes with a clean, responsive UI that works as a Progressive Web App.

## Key Features

- Complete game flow: New Game â†’ Bets â†’ Results â†’ Summary
- Automatic score calculation based on configurable rules
- Client-side data storage using IndexedDB (via Dexie.js)
- Export data to CSV for external analysis
- Responsive design via Tailwind CSS
- Progressive Web App capabilities (installable, offline support)
- Built with a modern React Hook-first architecture and Zustand state management

## Game Flow Implementation

The app implements the complete Skull King game flow:

1. **New Game** - Create a new game with players and number of rounds
2. **Bets** - Enter bids for each player in the current round
3. **Results** - Record tricks won, bonuses and special cards collected.
4. **Summary** - View final scores and game statistics with round-by-round accumulated score

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand (lightweight alternative to Redux)
- **Database**: Dexie.js (wrapper around IndexedDB for client-side storage)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **PWA Support**: Vite PWA plugin with Workbox

## Data Flow and Storage

- Game data is stored locally in the browser using IndexedDB via Dexie.js
- All game state is managed through Zustand store
- Round data includes bids, results per player, and calculated scores
- Special card tracking for Skull King, Pirates, Mermaids, etc.
- Automatic calculation of round scores based on configurable scoring rules

## Current Features Implemented

    âœ“ New Game creation with player management
    âœ“ Bid entry for each player in a round
    âœ“ Results entry including tricks won and special cards (with collapsible section)
    âœ“ Automatic score calculation based on game rules
    âœ“ Round progression tracking
    âœ“ Game status management (in-progress, completed)
    âœ“ Final score summary page with round-by-round score detail
    âœ“ Local data persistence using IndexedDB
    âœ“ Responsive UI that works as a PWA

## Missing Functionality (According to Game Flow Requirements)

The following features are missing from the current implementation:

- Custom scoring rule configuration
- Advanced special card handling (more complex bonus calculations)
- Multi-round game statistics and analytics
- Player performance tracking across multiple games
- Data import functionality
- Cloud synchronization between devices

## Installation

```bash
# install deps
npm install
# run the dev server
npm run dev
# build for production
npm run build
```
