## Game Flow Implementation

The app implements the complete Skull King game flow:

1. **New Game** - Create a new game with players and number of rounds
2. **Bets** - Enter bids for each player in the current round
3. **Results** - Record tricks won, bonuses and special cards collected.
4. **Summary** - View final scores and game statistics with round-by-round accumulated score

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand (lightweight alternative to Redux)
- **Database**: Dexie.js (wrapper around IndexedDB for client-side storage)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **PWA Support**: Vite PWA plugin with Workbox

## Data Flow and Storage

- Game data is stored locally in the browser using IndexedDB via Dexie.js
- All game state is managed through Zustand store
- Round data includes bids, results per player, and calculated scores
- Special card tracking for Skull King, Pirates, Mermaids, etc.
- Automatic calculation of round scores based on configurable scoring rules
